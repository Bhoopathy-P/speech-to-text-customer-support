## üìò Project Title: Speech to Text for Transcription Services

### üß† Objective:

To build a **Speech-to-Text (STT)** system that transcribes audio input into readable text using machine learning or speech recognition libraries.

### üìÇ Contents:

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

1. **Introduction & Setup**

   * Installation of required libraries (e.g., `speech_recognition`, `pydub`, etc.).
   * Importing essential packages for audio handling and transcription.

2. **Audio Processing**

   * Loading audio files (e.g., WAV or MP3 format).
   * Converting audio formats if necessary using `pydub`.

3. **Speech Recognition**

   * Using libraries like `SpeechRecognition` to convert audio to text.
   * Implementation using recognizer and audio file instances.

4. **Transcription Output**

   * Displaying the transcribed text.
   * Handling exceptions or unclear audio.

5. **Optional Enhancements**

   * Notes or placeholders for integrating more advanced APIs (Google, IBM Watson, etc.).
   * Potential for GUI, batch processing, or multilingual support.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Libraries:

  * `speech_recognition`
  * `pydub`
  * `os`, `io`, etc.

---

## üöÄ How to Run:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install SpeechRecognition pydub
   ```
2. Provide audio input (e.g., `audio.wav`).
3. Run the notebook cells to convert audio to text.
4. Read and use the transcription result.

## üìå Notes:

* Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed if using `pydub` for audio format conversion.
* Background noise and audio clarity greatly affect transcription accuracy.
